# Microglia-Image-Enhancement
This repository provides python implementation of our work "VBET: Vesselness and Blob Enhancement Technique for 2D and 3D Microscopy Images of Mirroglia". 
This method is designed for microscopy image enhancement of cells with joint Blob-and-Vessel like structure, for example, microglia cells, astrocytes, etc.

The proposed enhancement method works for enhancing both 2D image and 3D image stacks. To perform 2D enhancement, run 'demo_2D.py' and for 3D enhancement, run 'demo_3D.py'.
